### https://mybinder.org/
#### code from Bioinformatics Programming (Prog II) - BINF 6112
#### Matt Fry mkfry@uncc.edu

### This site was intended to demonstrate fundementals and techniques obtained to parse and extract biological data

#### *When using mybinder.org, you basically are running a jupyter session on a remote machine so you most likely will need to install modules in order for the code to complie...  You might notice some commented sections such as:
```python3
import sys
{sys.executable} -m pip install pandas
{sys.executable} -m pip install matplotlib
```
#### You will need to preform these module installs everytime you open the mybinder option for the session goes away when you leave the mybinder.org session...
